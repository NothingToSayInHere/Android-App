# Android-App
app developed for the Android course

The app that I intend to develop is a note taking app.

I have chosen idea because I'm always taking notes, on paper and also on my phone.

This is an opportunity to make it my own and customize it in such a way that it will follow my needs as close as possible.

Seeing as how we ar more or less at the beginning, I am not sure what capabilities can be implemented so I will add those user stories that I can forsee at the moment and add to them others about I will find out during the course.

Requirements:

- as a user I want to be able to add a note so that I can view it later
- as a user I want to be able to edit a note so that I can alter it if needed
- as a user I want to be able to delete a note so that it is no longer stored
- as a user I want to be able to search through my list of notes so that I can find the one I am looking for

Completed requirements:
- add note       - [x]
- edit note      - [ ]
- delete note    - [x]
- search in note - [x]
